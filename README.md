run with python3 index.py

A script that pulls data from r/wsb (filters by flair to keep it a bit more relevant), with the eventual hope that we can see what is reaching meme level hype, despite still being relatively cheap.

One application of the data is to use for options trading. The more hyped a stock is the higher its IV is going to get as retail investors pile in, thereby driving the price of derivatives on that stock up.

Main focus now is organizing WSB data (general proxy for market hype) and market data under tickers in the same data set. Once that is done we can figure out how to use for analytical purposes.
